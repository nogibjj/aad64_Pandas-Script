# aad64_Pandas-Script
Week 2 Mini-Project

This assignment is designed to introduce us to pandas descriptive scripts. 

Here, I have created a project which calculates the mean of a given dataset input, and returns the result. I have also created a test file to ensure that the mean function is correctly functioning (using an assert function).

The contents of this project are: .devcontainer (with a devcontainer.json and a Dockerfile), Github Actions, .gitignore file, Makefile, requirements.txt, main.py, test_main.py, and iris.csv.
