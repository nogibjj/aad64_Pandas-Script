Week 2 Mini-Project

This assignment is designed to introduce us to pandas descriptive scripts. For the same, the main edit made was to add pandas==2.1.0 to my requirements.txt file.

Here, I have created a project which has functions dedicated to doing the following on a given dataset and returning the output: 
* Calculating the mean,
* Calculating the median,
* Calculating the standard deviation,
* Visualizing data in the form of a scatterplot (below is the function run on a small, example dataset created in the [test_main.py](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/test_main.py) file).

I have also created a test file to ensure that the mean, median, and standard deviation functions are correctly functioning (using asserts).

The contents of this project are: 
* .devcontainer (with a [devcontainer.json](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile)), 
* [Github Actions](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/.github/workflows/actions.yml), 
* .gitignore file, 
* [Makefile](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/Makefile), 
* [requirements.txt](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/requirements.txt), 
* [main.py](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/main.py), 
* [test_main.py](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/test_main.py), and 
* [iris.csv](https://github.com/nogibjj/aad64_Pandas-Script/edit/main/iris.csv).
