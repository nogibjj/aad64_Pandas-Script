Week 2 Mini-Project

This assignment is designed to introduce us to pandas descriptive scripts. For the same, the main edit made was to add pandas==2.1.0 to my requirements.txt file.

Here, I have created a project which calculates the mean of a given dataset input, and returns the result. I have also created a test file to ensure that the mean function is correctly functioning (using an assert function).

The contents of this project are: 
.devcontainer (with a devcontainer.json and a Dockerfile), 
Github Actions, 
.gitignore file, 
Makefile, 
requirements.txt, 
main.py, 
test_main.py, and 
iris.csv.
